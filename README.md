# COVID-19-ML-project
# Machine learning-based prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis based on symptoms
# Overview
- The effective screening of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in the quick and efficient diagnosis of COVID-19, and it can significantly reduce the burden on healthcare systems. To assist medical staff in triaging patients, especially in the context of limited healthcare resources, prediction models have been developed that combine several features to estimate the risk of infection. In this regard, a machine-learning approach was established that trained on records from 67,584 tested individuals, of whom 4,747 were confirmed to have COVID-19. The test set contained data from the subsequent week, where 51,810 tested individuals were reported, of whom 4,760 were confirmed to have COVID-19. Using only eight binary features, such as sex, age ≥60 years, known contact with an infected individual, and the appearance of five initial clinical symptoms, The model was developed based on the data reported by the 'ABC' government, making it a practical tool to detect COVID-19 cases through simple features accessed by asking basic questions.

# Learnings
• Utilised Machine Learning approach to train 80% of the COVID-19 data.
• Based on the model built, tested the remaining 20% data, further performed systematic analysis to draw 
appropriate conclusions regarding the ability of the machine learning model to detect true positive and true 
negative cases based on the training and testing set.
• The input fed to the model was a questionnaire consisting of 8 simple questions which gave the necessary 
output indicating whether the person has COVID-19 or not
